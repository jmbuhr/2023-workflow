title: "Sharpening the Axe"
subtitle: "Reproducible Data Analysis at the Speed of Thought"
abstract: |
  This talk is all about workflows and tools.
  We will learn about `Quarto`, the next iteration of Rmarkdown
  and integrate it into our workflow.
  We will see the `targets` R package in action to help us
  keep track of complicated analysis pipelines and produce
  verifiably reproducible results.
  Lastly, we will venture into uncharted territory to find
  out first hand, why it always pays off to learn the intricacies
  of your tools with a live demonstration of using `Quarto` and
  `targets` in `Neovim`.

# Warmup!

## Remember these letters

```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 7)
```

[xfwiadcnanvrqybceawgjdczlyhlwoovxxce]{#letters}

## Remember these letters

How many of these letters do you remember?

## Remember these letters

```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 7)
```

[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]{#letters}

## Remember these letters

Do you remember the sentence on the previous slide?

. . .

Of course you do, it's just **one** sentence!

. . .

But it has the **same number of characters** as the random letters.

## The Magic 7 $+/-$ 2

One piece of information is a **thunk**.

. . . 

We can keep **7 thunks** in our **working memory**

. . .

We gain space by combining thoughts and **concepts**
