# Warmup!

## Remember these letters

```{python}
from random import randint
from string import ascii_letters
# from palmerpenguins import penguins
```

```{python}
sentence = "How many of these letters did you remember?"

letters = ""
for c in sentence:
  if c != " ":
    c = ascii_letters[randint(0, 25)]
      
  letters += c

print(letters)
```

<!-- TODO: add timmer -->

## Remember these letters

How many of these letters did you remember?

## Remember these letters

Do you remember the question on the previous slide?

. . .

Of course you do, it's just **one** sentence!

. . .

But it has the **same number of characters** as the random letters.

## Thunks

## Who am I?

# Optimize Your Workflow

## Keyboard Shortcuts are not just for Speed!

# Optimize your Code

## Code is communication

## Put the fun in Functional Programming

### Pure Functions

```{python}
def count_penguins_by_species_v1():
  pass
```


```{python}
def count_penguins_by_species_v2(data):
  return {}
```


```{python}
test_data = {

}
expected_result = {

}
assert count_penguins_by_species_v2(test_data) == expected_result
```
